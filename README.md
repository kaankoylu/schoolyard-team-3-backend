# Project Overview

This project is a web application that helps teachers and students design a green school playground together. This web application consists of a design process integrated into an interactive game-like environment that helps engage students of all ages to design their future environment.

The system comes with a full frontend and backend environment.

**Frontend**
The frontend is a SvelteKit application that provides the main user interface for both the teacher and the elementary school students.

**Backend**
THe backend uses Node/Express API responsible for managing the sessions, templates, the user roles, assets and the design submissions made by students

With thes components we form a working application rather than a conceptual prototype

# Goal

The purpose of this tool is to support schools in creating greener, more engaging schoolyards by providing a structured, collaborative design environment. The system enables schools to:

* Upload and/or select the schoolyard map used for the design exercise
* Allow students to design yard layouts using drag-and-drop visual elements
* Collect, store and manage student submissions
* Compare, evaluate and combine designs for decision-making
* Provide structure and inspiration throughout the design process

The result is a digital platform that supports collaboration, creativity and sustainability within education.

# Sprint Background

This project originated from a Design Sprint. The team performed:

* User research and interviews with teachers and students
* Competitive and inspirational analysis
* Concept sketching and solution exploration
* Prototyping using Figma and AI-assisted tools
* User testing with students, teachers and a parent

User testing results averaged **7.95/10**, validating the concept and guiding improvements.

The current GitHub repository represents the implementation phase of the validated prototype.
